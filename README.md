# Simulator

2022 is FIFA world Cup year. As a big fan of soccer I decided to build this project to help me play with the possible results.

The **_first phase_** is to have a functional prototype with the current edition of the world cup by the end of february 2022.

The **_second phase_** is to have a world cup draw simulator as a tab in the application by the end of march.

The **_third phase_** is to update the app because the format of the competiton is changing after the 2022 edition.

The project will use Vue.Js in the frontend, Sass to help with CSS and json-server to act as a mock backend.
